# AM-PROJECT
The circuit appears to be an Amplitude Modulation (AM) circuit for analog communication 

Description of AM Circuit:


1-Baseband Signal Source: Represents the low-frequency signal which is to be modulated. This is connected to the input of a modulator circuit.

2-Carrier Signal Source: A high-frequency signal generated by an oscillator, which is the carrier wave for modulation. This signal is used to "carry" the baseband signal.

3-Modulator (AD633 IC): The core of the AM circuit is typically a modulator IC. This analog multiplier IC modulates the baseband signal onto the carrier signal through amplitude variation.

4-Transistor Amplifier (Q1, 2N2222): This stage boosts the modulated signal's power as an amplifier, often required for transmission over a medium.

5-Capacitors and Resistors: These components serve filtering, biasing, and coupling purposes to ensure stable operation and clean modulation.

6-Output Section: After modulation, the signal is filtered and amplified further before being transmitted.

The key concept here is that the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the baseband signal, creating the AM signal suitable for analog communication.
